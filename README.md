# Clary AI Development ü§ñ
  
## About the project üìú

This is the test of the development of an AI with c#, currently this application only works on a windows machine with the en-GB language pack but eventually improvements will be made.

Again, this project was built for a windows OS and we do **NOT** provide support for any other one or get the responsibility for any anomalies that it might cause.
